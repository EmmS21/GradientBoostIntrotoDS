We also know that we will need to store this number in a variable in order to compare it with the input we get from the user at a later stage.\n",

If we don't already know how to do this we would research how to do this and quickly find out that we can use the inbuilt input() function that will prompt a user for some keyboard input Read More about this function here: https://stackabuse.com/getting-user-input-in-python/\n",

In the event that the user enters a string than cannot be converted into an integer we will need a way to handle this error. One way of doing this is through what is referred to as handling exceptions. You can write a program that can handle certain exceptions, in this case we would need to handle a Value Error. In this instance this refers to an error pertaining to the content of the object we have tried to assign the value to. Read More about this here: http://cs.carleton.edu/cs_comps/1213/pylearn/final_results/encyclopedia/valueError.html\n",

For more on handling exceptions read more here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we ensure that the user's input has been converted into an integer we may need to think about how we will handle the core logic of our program, that is as long as the user's input does not match the random number we need to continue to ask for the user's input until either the input matches the guess or the number of guesses reaches 3. So in other words. While the number of guesses is less than 3 we will ask for the user's guess. If the guess is correct we will print out a message indicating that the user has won the game, if the user's guess is incorrect we will continue asking the user's input until s/he either correctly guesses the number or the number of his/her guesses reaches the nuber 3. This means that we need to create a variable, assign the number 0 to it and continue to increment this variable by 1 for each iteration.\n",

    "One clear think that pops up is that we will need to build a list of numbers from 1 to 100 and iterate through this numbers. For each number we would want to use a comparison operator to test whether the number is a mulitple of 3,5 or both 3 and 5. From previous examples we already know that we could potentially use the modulo operator to test if dividing a number by 3,5 or both would return a remainder equal to 0. This would mean that the number is a multiple of 3,5 or both depending on what we are testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple way to translate this reasoning into code is through a mixture of a for loop to iterate through the list of numbers we create and if else statements to test if the number we are currently looking at is divisible by 3,5 or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what happens when we encounter a number like 15 that is both divisible by 3 and 5. If we use if statements and for example the first if statement checks if 15 is divisible by 3 we will print out Fizz instead of FizzBuzz since. This is because if an 'if' condition evalutes to true the program will execute the statement associated with the if statement and move on to the next number. One way to factor this into the logic of our program is to only print Fizz if the number is a multiple of 3 and not a multiple of 5, Buzz if the number is a multiple of 5 and not a multiple of 3 and FizzBuzz is the number is divisible by both 3 and 5. For every other number we would simply print out the number itself\n"

The basic components of a list comprehension are the output expression, the iterable and the iterator variable. For example we can create a List comprehension of the every whole number from 1 to 5 multiplied by two. Whereas we would typically do this by writing a for loop to iterate through each number in our list, multiply the number by 2 and append the output to a new list. We could list comprehension to do this in just one line of code.\n",

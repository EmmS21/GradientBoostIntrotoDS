The Gradient Boost is an online Data Science school aimed at teaching skills related to Data Science. While our school is entirely online. We believe that learning requires a constant feedback loop. You learn more effectively if you get good feedback as you learn a new skill helping you correct any misinterpretations or incorrect assumptions you may have. In order to build this loop into our school once enrolled you have have access to 2 live video tutorial classes per week guided by a mentor. The mentor in this context will be an experienced Data Scientist who will help answer any questions you have regarded the course content, your projects or assignments. Each tutorial will be attended by peers also learning Data Science through our school.In some instances you may overlook certain questions or issues, however having your peers attend the same tutorial will help cover more issues and questions that may be beneficial to your learning experience.Because of the practical nature of Data Science, there will be a strong focus on practical application of the skills you acquire, prefaced by a theory. You will have access to interactive notebooks to show you both the practical application of concepts from a programming perspective, the intuition behind different concepts as well as the theory. We are currently only launching a rigorous introductory course, but will be building a full length advanced bootcamp soon. Type in "site" to get our URL. Please note that there are still some changes that are being made to the site.
